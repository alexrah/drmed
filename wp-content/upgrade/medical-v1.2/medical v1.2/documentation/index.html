		</ul>

		<p>After you've installed WordPress and when everything is working fine as it should you need to go over some settings, just to make sure your wordpress is working without any problems.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Activate the threaded comments, go to <strong>Setings &rarr; Discussion</strong> and select <strong>Enable threaded (nested) comment 5 levels deep.</strong></li>
			<li>Change permalinks by going to  <strong>Settings &rarr; Permalinks</strong> and select <strong>“Custom Structure”</strong> write <em>/%postname%/ </em> inside the input field, there’s one problem though, some hosts handles these permalink settings differently, when the normal method does not work try to ad this <em>index.php?/%postname%/</em> or else contact your host for help on this matter. Some hosts may have mod_security options enabled so you need to copy the given code when you save changes for Custom Structure and paste in the ".htaccess" in your wordpress root directory.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>That's it for activating and installing wordpress theme and general settings.</p>

		<h2 class="name">02<span>Installing the theme</span></h2>
		<p class="note">Our themes uses TimThumb to resize the images.</p>
		<p>TimThumb requires the <a href="http://www.libgd.org/Main_Page" target="blank">GD library</a>, which is available on many hosting severs with PHP 4.3+ installed. Please set the cache folder permission to 777 if images are not showing after activating theme and setting slider. Still encountering problems with your images, then please visit <a href="http://themeforest.net/forums/thread/tim-thumb-problem/32860?page=1#311234">tim thumb not working</a> topic which was discussed on themeforest forum for help on solving the timthumb issue. If you don't want to use the timthumb then you need to use the appropriate sizes for the post thumbnails and slider images and disable the timthumb option from Energetic &rarr; Theme Options &rarr; General Tab.</em></p>
